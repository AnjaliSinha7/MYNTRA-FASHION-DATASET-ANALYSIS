# MYNTRA-FASHION-DATASET-ANALYSIS

This project explores and analyzes the Myntra Fashion Dataset, available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/djagatiya/myntra-fashion-product-dataset. The goal is to gain insights into fashion trends, product categories, and other relevant information through data analysis and visualization techniques.

## Dataset

The Myntra Fashion Dataset contains images of fashion products along with their associated attributes like product ID, name ,color, brand, distribution, price etc.  It provides a rich source of information for understanding fashion trends and consumer preferences. 

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization:

* **pandas:** For data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.
* **numpy:** For numerical operations.
* **matplotlib:** For creating static visualizations.
* **seaborn:** For creating statistical visualizations.

## Project Description

This project aimed to:

* Explore the distribution of products across different categories, sub-categories, and article types.
* Analyze trends in fashion attributes like base color, brand and distribution.
* Investigate the relationship between product descriptions and their categories.
* Visualize fashion trends over time.
  

## Data Analysis and Visualization

The project involved the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning:** The dataset was loaded using pandas. 
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** EDA was performed to understand the data's characteristics. This involved calculating descriptive statistics, creating histograms, box plots, and other visualizations to explore the distribution of variables.
3. **Data Visualization:**  matplotlib and seaborn were used to create visualizations that effectively communicate the insights gained from the EDA. 



## Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into the Myntra Fashion Dataset, revealing trends and patterns in the fashion industry.  These insights can be used for targeted marketing, product recommendation, and trend forecasting
